# ![#livelaughlof](./selfie.png) lofbot

The LOF Discord bot, which does useful (?) things.

## Getting started

1. Step zero: get a copy of the `.env` file
1. Step one: `yarn`
1. Step two: `yarn start`

### Noteworthy

All changes are pushed to Discord **every time a file is written**. Something
probably should be done to change that...
